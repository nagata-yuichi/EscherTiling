The following algorithms are implemented.
- EST with the Euclidean or AD distance 
- EST with the E_I or E_IR distance 
- Heuristic search with the E_I or E_IR distance 

# Environment
The author ran the programs on Ubuntu 16.04 (or 20.04), and the following preparations may be required to compile the source code. 
- Make the Eigen library (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) available on your PC. 
- Install the X11 library on your PC. 
```
$ sudo apt install libx11-dev 
```

# Goal figures
Directory Data contains some goal figure files, which are divided into two types. 
- Polygonal type: e.g. pegasus_60.dat 
- Mesh type: e.g. pegasus_60_27.dat 

See document.txt in directory Data for the data format.  

# How to use 
It is recommended to run EST with the Euclidean distance first because this is the most basic one. 

## EST with the Euclidean or AD distance 
Before compiling the program, rewrite parts of the program directly. 
- Set EST in line 4 of env_E.h.
- Set E or AD in line 4 of search_E_EST.h, depending on whether the Euclidean or AD distance is used.  

Compile:
```
$ ./build_E.exe
$ mv jikken jikken_E
```
Then, a executable file jikken_E is created.

Execution:  
Run the following command in the directory including the data file of a goal figure. 
```
$ ./jikken_E <string1> <string2> <integer1> <integer2>
```
  
\<string1\> : file name of a goal figure (polygonal type)  
\<string2\> : file name to which results are written  
\<integer1\> : results are displayed?  0:no, 1:yes  
\<integer2\> : the number of top solutions stored  

(Example)
```
$ ./jikken_E pegasus_60.dat ABC 1 20
```
   
Result:  
The specified number of top solutions are saved in a file (ABC_pegasus_60.dat.tile in this example) and are displayed in the terminal, as shown in the example below 
```
order =  0 eval=18994.244366: IH= 6 (18 4 18 7 4 3 ) 22  
order =  1 eval=21028.815657: IH= 6 (5 14 5 12 14 4 ) 48  
order =  2 eval=21868.573515: IH= 4 (13 4 7 13 14 3 ) 20  
....  
```

Each line represent the following values:  
  order: ranking of the solution  
  eval : the distance value  
  IH   : Isohedral type  
  ( , , ...) : the numbers of points assigned to the tiling edges of the template  
  bright-most number : the value of j (see [1] or [2])  

If \<integer1\> = 1, the top solutions (tile figures) are displayed. Press the return key to display the next solution. 

The top solutions stored in a file can also be displayed (see "Display Result").

## Constructing a tiling

The class `csk::IsohedralTiling` can be used to describe a specific tiling and its prototile.  It has a single constructor that takes the desired tiling type as an argument.  The tiling type is expressed as an integer representing a legal isohedral type.  These are all numbers between 1 and 93 (inclusive), but there are some holesâ€”for example, there is no Type 19.  The array `csk::tiling_types`, with length `csk::num_types` (fixed at 81) contains the legal types:

```C++
// Suppose you wanted to loop over all the tiling types...
for( size_t idx = 0; idx < csk::num_types; ++idx ) {
    // Create a new tiling of the given type, with default shape.
    csk::IsohedralTiling a_tiling( csk::tiling_types[ idx ] );
    // Do something with this tiling type
}
```
